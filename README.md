# Flight-Booking-prototype
This project, written in python, is a database based flight booking prototype, in which the concepts of DSA are applied. all the other information is available in the files attached
Details
1) Our program contains linked list queue and python list
2) Our structure is : two linked lists(Domestic and internation) each having all the flights in linked list nodes.each flight has linked list of day wise flight.each dauwise flight has linked list of passangers data
3) Our program work on weekly schedule i.e. flights are reshudle weekely according to users current time
4) We can load add or remove flights from program just by using FFF text file
5) Our flight simulation database is Stored in file Flihgt passangers simulation 
6) This database only work for the purpose of making database which means all the booking are added into the file and perminanately stored but if we cancela booking it is only cancelled for the specifit runtime but not removed from the database
7) Our program can handle collsion of flights well
8) In our program you cant book flight for the same day as per 24hr prior booking policy if selected same day user will get get flight for the next weeks same day
9) In our program cnic is used to identify the user 
10) In out program a sinlge user cant book two seats in the same flight under same CNIC
11) In our program automatically chargers are calculated from flight distance
12) Our make a trip is not stored in the file it is just for run time and deletes as program ends
13) However we can make trips as many as we want(to be resize 50)  while running the program
14) There exist a Queue to booking flight if 100 booking exceeds.if any seatbooking is cancelled from the requested booking flight(Queued) it will book flight from the Queue automatically.
